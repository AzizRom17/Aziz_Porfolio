# [Project 1: Data Science Project: Car classificator Project Overview](https://github.com/AzizRom17/Car_classification)
* Clustered different car models from a car dealer catalog with over 200k rows into classes.
* Chose the optimal number of classes (clusters) with various techniques such as T-SNE and PCA for dimension reduction and visualization.
* Developed a classification model that predicts the most suitable car class to a client based on the client's info (trained the model on a dataset of over 2 million rows).
* Optimized Random Forest Classificator model using GridSearchCV to reach the best model.
* Engineered features and chose the optimal number of features for our model using Recursive feature elimination with cross-validation.
* Used a pipeline in order to deal with our data and pass it to our model.
