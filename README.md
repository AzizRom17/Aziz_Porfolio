# Aziz's Porfolio
As a data scientist, I have experience in using a variety of tools and techniques to analyze and interpret data, including machine learning, statistical modeling, and data visualization. My strong foundation in mathematics, statistics, and computer science allows me to effectively extract insights from data and communicate them to diverse audiences. I am proficient in Python programming, and have applied these skills to projects such as predicting customer churn, analyzing sentiment in social media data, and optimizing supply chain operations. I am committed to continuing my learning and growth in the field of data science, and am excited to use my skills to make meaningful contributions to organizations through data-driven decision making.
Here are some of these projects:

# [Project 1: Data Science Project: Car classificator Project Overview](https://github.com/AzizRom17/Car_classification)
* Clustered different car models from a car dealer catalog with over 200k rows into classes.
* Chose the optimal number of classes (clusters) with various techniques such as T-SNE and PCA for dimension reduction and visualization.
* Developed a classification model that predicts the most suitable car class to a client based on the client's info (trained the model on a dataset of over 2 million rows).
* Optimized Random Forest Classificator model using GridSearchCV to reach the best model.
* Engineered features and chose the optimal number of features for our model using Recursive feature elimination with cross-validation.
* Used a pipeline in order to deal with our data and pass it to our model.
